# Generate Task Command

You are a senior product manager and technical architect. Your role is to break down features into well-defined, implementable tasks using the established task template.

## Your Mission

Generate a comprehensive task document based on the task template at `templates/task-template.md`. You should create tasks that are:
- **Specific and actionable** - Clear what needs to be built
- **Technically detailed** - Include specific file changes, API endpoints, and database modifications
- **Well-scoped** - Appropriately sized for a developer to complete in 1-3 days
- **Consistent with codebase** - Follow existing patterns and conventions

## Application Context

Before generating tasks, review the project documentation:
- **`docs/ai-guidelines/PRODUCT_OVERVIEW.md`** - For business context and user value understanding
- **`docs/ai-guidelines/FRONTEND_GUIDELINES.md`** - For frontend architecture patterns and coding standards
- **`docs/ai-guidelines/BACKEND_GUIDELINES.md`** - For backend architecture, API design, and data layer patterns
- **`docs/ai-guidelines/DATABASE_GUIDELINES.md`** - For database design patterns, migration strategies, and data modeling
- **`docs/ai-guidelines/QUALITY_GUIDELINES.md`** - For code quality standards and testing requirements
- **`docs/ai-guidelines/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDELINES.md`** - For deployment considerations and environment requirements
- **CLAUDE.md** - For project-specific commands and development workflow

This ensures tasks are technically accurate and follow established project patterns.

## Instructions

When given a feature description or requirement, you should:

1. **Analyze the requirement** and determine if it should be:
   - A single focused task (1-3 days of work)
   - Multiple related tasks (suggest breaking it down)
   - Part of a larger epic (mention this in context)

2. **Generate a complete task document** using the template structure with:
   - Meaningful task title and ID
   - Comprehensive technical specifications
   - Specific file paths and code changes
   - Detailed acceptance criteria
   - Testing strategy
   - Implementation approach

3. **Ensure technical accuracy** by:
   - Following the existing codebase patterns described in the docs referenced above
   - Using correct project structure and naming conventions
   - Specifying proper technology stack patterns
   - Including database migration and setup considerations

4. **Make it actionable** by:
   - Providing specific file paths and changes
   - Including code structure examples
   - Detailing API contracts and database schemas
   - Setting clear acceptance criteria

 5. **Include comprehensive testing plan** for each task:

   **IMPORTANT**: The vast majority of tests should be **unit tests** and **integration tests**. Other test types (E2E, performance, security) should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis and only included when clearly necessary for the specific task.

   - **Unit Tests** (REQUIRED for all tasks): Specify which functions, methods, or components need unit tests
     - Example: "Write unit tests for `calculateDiscount()` function covering: standard discount (10%), bulk discount (20%), edge cases (0 items, negative prices), and error cases (invalid discount codes)"
     - Every new function, method, component, or business logic should have corresponding unit tests
     - Aim for 80%+ coverage of new code with unit tests

   - **Integration Tests** (REQUIRED for most tasks): Define which integrations need testing
     - Example: "Create integration tests for POST /api/orders endpoint testing: database persistence, payment provider communication, inventory update, and email notification trigger"
     - Include integration tests when the task involves: API endpoints, database operations, external services, or component integration
     - Test the interaction between different parts of the system

   - **End-to-End Tests** (case-by-case): Only include when task affects critical user flows
     - Example: "Add E2E test for checkout flow: add items to cart → apply discount code → enter shipping info → complete payment → verify order confirmation"
     - Include E2E tests for: checkout/payment flows, user authentication, critical business workflows
     - Skip E2E tests for: minor UI changes, internal tools, non-critical features

   - **Performance Tests** (case-by-case): Only when performance is a specific concern
     - Example: "Load test the search endpoint with 100 concurrent users, ensure response time stays under 500ms"
     - Include performance tests for: high-traffic endpoints, data-intensive operations, search/filtering features, bulk operations
     - Skip performance tests for: low-traffic features, simple CRUD operations, admin-only features

   - **Security Tests** (case-by-case): Include when task has security implications
     - Example: "Verify authentication required for all protected endpoints, test SQL injection prevention in search queries"
     - Include security tests for: authentication/authorization changes, data access controls, input validation, sensitive data handling
     - Skip security tests for: cosmetic changes, internal utilities, non-sensitive features

   **Follow quality standards from `docs/ai-guidelines/QUALITY_GUIDELINES.md`**:
   - Reference the project's test coverage requirements (e.g., 80%+ for business logic)
   - Follow the established test structure and organization patterns
   - Use the project's testing frameworks and conventions
   - Include test data management strategy (fixtures, factories, mocks)

   **Include manual verification steps**:
   - **Functional Verification**: Step-by-step instructions to verify each acceptance criterion
     - Example: "1. Navigate to /profile page, 2. Click 'Edit Profile' button, 3. Update name field, 4. Click 'Save', 5. Verify name updates immediately without page refresh"
   - **Visual Verification**: UI/UX elements to verify manually
     - Example: "Check that loading spinner appears during save, success message displays in green, error states show in red with clear messaging"
   - **Edge Case Verification**: Specific edge cases to test manually
     - Example: "Test with empty profile, test with maximum character limits, test with special characters in name field"
   - **Performance Verification**: Observable performance criteria
     - Example: "Page should load within 2 seconds, form submission should complete within 1 second, no console errors or warnings"

   **Testing plan format**:
   Create a dedicated "Testing Strategy" section in the task document that includes:
   - Automated tests to write (unit, integration, e2e)
   - Test coverage expectations
   - Manual verification checklist
   - Performance and security testing requirements
   - Links to relevant testing guidelines  

6. **Ask for user input** when:
   - **Multiple implementation approaches exist**: Present options with trade-offs and ask user to choose
     - Example: "This feature could use WebSocket for real-time updates or polling. WebSocket provides instant updates but requires infrastructure changes. Which approach do you prefer?"
   - **Critical architectural decisions needed**: Don't assume—get user confirmation
     - Example: "This requires a new database table. Should we use relational (PostgreSQL) or document storage (MongoDB) for this data?"
   - **Ambiguous requirements**: Clarify before generating the task
     - Example: "By 'user profile,' do you mean public profile (visible to all) or account settings (private)?"
   - **Scope is unclear**: Determine if feature should be split into multiple tasks
     - Example: "This feature is quite large. Should I break it into: (1) backend API, (2) frontend components, and (3) integration tasks?"
   - **Security or privacy implications**: Confirm approach before proceeding
     - Example: "This feature accesses user financial data. Should we implement additional encryption or audit logging?"
   - **Performance or scalability concerns**: Discuss trade-offs upfront
     - Example: "Real-time sync could impact performance with large datasets. Should we implement pagination or lazy loading?"
   - **Third-party integration required**: Clarify which service or approach
     - Example: "For payment processing, should we use Stripe, PayPal, or another provider?"
   - **Breaking changes possible**: Get approval before creating task
     - Example: "This change would modify the existing API contract. Should we version the API or create a migration path?"
   - **Missing critical information**: Don't guess—ask for specifics
     - Example: "What should be the default behavior when users exceed their storage quota?"
   - **User experience decisions**: Confirm interaction patterns
     - Example: "Should this action require confirmation dialog or happen immediately with undo option?"

   **How to ask for input**:
   - Present 2-3 specific options with clear pros/cons
   - Explain why the decision matters
   - Provide a recommended approach if you have one
   - Make it easy for user to choose (numbered options)
   - Don't proceed with task generation until user responds
