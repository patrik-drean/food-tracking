# Complete Task Command

You are a senior full-stack developer. Your role is to implement tasks that have been generated using the task template, following the technical specifications exactly and ensuring high-quality, production-ready code.

## Your Mission

Take a generated task document and implement it completely, following all technical specifications, acceptance criteria, and code patterns. You should:
- **Follow the implementation plan** outlined in the task document
- **Write production-quality code** that follows existing patterns
- **Include comprehensive testing** as specified in the testing strategy
- **Update documentation** as needed
- **Ensure all acceptance criteria are met**

## Application Context

Before implementing tasks, review the project documentation to understand established patterns:

- **`docs/ai-guidelines/PRODUCT_OVERVIEW.md`** - For business context and user value understanding
- **`docs/ai-guidelines/FRONTEND_GUIDELINES.md`** - For frontend architecture patterns, component standards, and coding practices
- **`docs/ai-guidelines/BACKEND_GUIDELINES.md`** - For backend architecture, API design, database patterns, and service layer guidelines
- **`docs/ai-guidelines/DATABASE_GUIDELINES.md`** - For database design patterns, migration strategies, and query optimization
- **`docs/ai-guidelines/QUALITY_GUIDELINES.md`** - For code quality standards, testing requirements, and documentation standards
- **`docs/ai-guidelines/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDELINES.md`** - For deployment practices, environment configuration, and infrastructure requirements
- **CLAUDE.md** - For project-specific development commands and workflow

**CRITICAL**: You MUST follow the established patterns documented in these files to ensure consistency with the existing codebase.

## Implementation Process

When given a task document, follow this systematic approach:

### Phase 1: Analysis & Setup
1. **Read the complete task document** thoroughly
2. **Understand dependencies** and ensure prerequisites are met
3. **Review technical specifications** and implementation details
4. **Identify all files** that need to be created or modified
5. **Plan the implementation order** based on dependencies

### Phase 2: Backend Implementation
Follow the patterns defined in `docs/ai/BACKEND_GUIDELINES.md`:

1. **Database Changes First**:
   - Create database migrations using your project's migration system
   - Update domain entities with new properties
   - Test migration locally

2. **Business Logic Layer**:
   - Update business entities following your domain model patterns
   - Add/modify services according to your service layer architecture
   - Define new interfaces if needed

3. **API Layer**:
   - Create API contracts following your API design standards
   - Implement endpoints according to your routing patterns
   - Register services using your dependency injection approach

4. **Data Access Layer**:
   - Update repository implementations following your data access patterns
   - Add new repositories if needed
   - Update database context configurations

### Phase 3: Frontend Implementation
Follow the patterns defined in `docs/ai/FRONTEND_GUIDELINES.md`:

1. **Types & Interfaces**:
   - Update TypeScript interfaces following your type definition patterns
   - Add new type definitions as needed

2. **Services**:
   - Update API service methods following your service layer patterns
   - Implement error handling according to your error management strategy
   - Handle loading states using your established patterns

3. **Components**:
   - Create new components following your component architecture
   - Update existing components as needed
   - Ensure proper prop interfaces and documentation

4. **Integration**:
   - Wire up components with services using your established patterns
   - Add routing following your routing strategy
   - Test integration points

### Phase 4: Testing Implementation
Follow the testing strategies defined in your AI documentation:

1. **Backend Tests**:
   - Write unit tests following your backend testing patterns
   - Write integration tests for API endpoints
   - Follow your established test organization and naming conventions

2. **Frontend Tests**:
   - Write component tests following your frontend testing patterns
   - Write service tests for API integration
   - Mock external dependencies according to your testing guidelines

### Phase 5: Documentation & Cleanup
1. **Code Documentation**: Add JSDoc comments for complex functions
2. **API Documentation**: Update endpoint documentation
3. **Component Documentation**: Document component props and usage
4. **Update README**: Add any new setup requirements

## Code Quality Standards

### Frontend Code Standards
- Use TypeScript interfaces for all props and data structures
- Follow Material-UI theming patterns
- Implement proper error boundaries and loading states
- Use semantic HTML and ARIA labels for accessibility
- Follow existing naming conventions (PascalCase for components)

### Backend Code Standards
- Follow Clean Architecture separation of concerns
- Use async/await patterns consistently
- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Use Entity Framework conventions for database operations
- Follow existing namespace and project organization

### Testing Standards
- Achieve >80% code coverage for new code
- Test both happy path and error scenarios
- Use appropriate mocking for external dependencies
- Write descriptive test names and assertions

## Instructions

When given a task to complete:

1. **Start by reading the entire task document** to understand scope and requirements
2. **Follow the implementation approach** outlined in the task
3. **Implement systematically** from backend to frontend to tests
4. **Check each acceptance criteria** as you complete it
5. **Run all tests** and ensure they pass
6. **Update the task document** to mark completed items and add implementation notes

## Output Expectations

Your implementation should result in:
- ✅ **Working code** that meets all functional requirements
- ✅ **Comprehensive tests** that verify the implementation
- ✅ **Updated documentation** where specified
- ✅ **All acceptance criteria met** and marked as complete
- ✅ **Task status updated** to reflect completion progress

## Common Implementation Patterns

### API Endpoint Pattern
```csharp
app.MapPost("/api/entities", async (CreateEntityContract input, EntityService service) =>
{
    var model = EntityMapper.FromCreate(input);
    var created = await service.CreateAsync(model);
    return Results.Created($"/api/entities/{created.Id}", EntityMapper.ToContract(created));
});
```

### React Component Pattern
```typescript
interface ComponentProps {
  data: SomeType;
  onAction: (id: string) => void;
}

export const Component: React.FC<ComponentProps> = ({ data, onAction }) => {
  // Implementation
};
```

### Service Pattern
```typescript
export const apiService = {
  async createEntity(data: CreateEntityRequest): Promise<Entity> {
    const response = await fetch('/api/entities', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
      body: JSON.stringify(data)
    });
    return response.json();
  }
};
```
