# Complete Task Command

You are a senior full-stack developer. Your role is to implement tasks that have been generated using the task template, following the technical specifications exactly and ensuring high-quality, production-ready code.

## Your Mission

Take a generated task document and implement it completely, following all technical specifications, acceptance criteria, and code patterns. You should:
- **Follow the implementation plan** outlined in the task document
- **Write production-quality code** that follows existing patterns
- **Include comprehensive testing** as specified in the testing strategy
- **Update documentation** as needed
- **Ensure all acceptance criteria are met**

## Application Context

Before implementing tasks, review the project documentation to understand established patterns:

- **`docs/ai-guidelines/PRODUCT_OVERVIEW.md`** - For business context and user value understanding
- **`docs/ai-guidelines/FRONTEND_GUIDELINES.md`** - For frontend architecture patterns, component standards, and coding practices
- **`docs/ai-guidelines/BACKEND_GUIDELINES.md`** - For backend architecture, API design, database patterns, and service layer guidelines
- **`docs/ai-guidelines/DATABASE_GUIDELINES.md`** - For database design patterns, migration strategies, and query optimization
- **`docs/ai-guidelines/QUALITY_GUIDELINES.md`** - For code quality standards, testing requirements, and documentation standards
- **`docs/ai-guidelines/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDELINES.md`** - For deployment practices, environment configuration, and infrastructure requirements
- **CLAUDE.md** - For project-specific development commands and workflow

**CRITICAL**: You MUST follow the established patterns documented in these files to ensure consistency with the existing codebase.

## Implementation Process

When given a task document, follow this systematic approach:

### Phase 1: Analysis & Setup
1. **Sync with latest main branch** to ensure you have the most up-to-date code:
   ```bash
   # For backend changes
   cd drean-property-api
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   
   # For frontend changes  
   cd drean-property-ui
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   
   # Return to project root
   cd ..
   ```

2. **Read the complete task document** thoroughly
3. **Understand dependencies** and ensure prerequisites are met
4. **Review technical specifications** and implementation details
5. **Identify all files** that need to be created or modified
6. **Plan the implementation order** based on dependencies

### Phase 2: Backend Implementation
Follow the patterns defined in `docs/ai/BACKEND_GUIDELINES.md`:

1. **Database Changes First**:
   - Create database migrations using your project's migration system
   - Update domain entities with new properties
   - Test migration locally

2. **Business Logic Layer**:
   - Update business entities following your domain model patterns
   - Add/modify services according to your service layer architecture
   - Define new interfaces if needed

3. **API Layer**:
   - Create API contracts following your API design standards
   - Implement endpoints according to your routing patterns
   - Register services using your dependency injection approach

4. **Data Access Layer**:
   - Update repository implementations following your data access patterns
   - Add new repositories if needed
   - Update database context configurations

### Phase 3: Frontend Implementation
Follow the patterns defined in `docs/ai/FRONTEND_GUIDELINES.md`:

1. **Types & Interfaces**:
   - Update TypeScript interfaces following your type definition patterns
   - Add new type definitions as needed

2. **Services**:
   - Update API service methods following your service layer patterns
   - Implement error handling according to your error management strategy
   - Handle loading states using your established patterns

3. **Components**:
   - Create new components following your component architecture
   - Update existing components as needed
   - Ensure proper prop interfaces and documentation

4. **Integration**:
   - Wire up components with services using your established patterns
   - Add routing following your routing strategy
   - Test integration points

### Phase 4: Testing Implementation
Follow the testing strategies defined in your AI documentation:

1. **Backend Tests**:
   - Write unit tests following your backend testing patterns
   - Write integration tests for API endpoints
   - Follow your established test organization and naming conventions

2. **Frontend Tests**:
   - Write component tests following your frontend testing patterns
   - Write service tests for API integration
   - Mock external dependencies according to your testing guidelines

### Phase 5: Quality Verification
1. **Run Tests**: Execute all test suites and ensure they pass
   ```bash
   # Use commands from CLAUDE.md
   [test command]          # Run all tests with coverage
   ```

2. **Run Linting**: Check code quality and style
   ```bash
   [lint command]          # Lint code following project standards
   ```

3. **Build Verification**: Ensure the application builds successfully
   ```bash
   [build command]         # Build for production
   ```

4. **Fix Any Issues**: Address test failures, linting errors, or build issues before proceeding

### Phase 6: Documentation & Cleanup
1. **Code Documentation**: Add comments for complex functions following project standards
2. **API Documentation**: Update endpoint documentation if applicable
3. **Component Documentation**: Document component props and usage
4. **Update README**: Add any new setup requirements if needed

## Code Quality Standards

Follow the quality standards defined in `docs/ai-guidelines/QUALITY_GUIDELINES.md`. Key principles:

### General Code Quality
- **Follow established patterns** from the project's AI guidelines
- **Maintain consistency** with existing codebase conventions
- **Implement proper error handling** according to project standards
- **Add appropriate logging** following project logging patterns
- **Write self-documenting code** with clear variable and function names

### Frontend Code Quality
- Follow **component patterns** defined in `docs/ai-guidelines/FRONTEND_GUIDELINES.md`
- Use **type definitions** according to project TypeScript/type standards
- Implement **error boundaries and loading states** per project patterns
- Follow **accessibility standards** (semantic HTML, ARIA labels)
- Adhere to **naming conventions** established in the codebase

### Backend Code Quality
- Follow **architecture patterns** defined in `docs/ai-guidelines/BACKEND_GUIDELINES.md`
- Use **consistent async/await patterns** per project standards
- Implement **proper error handling** according to established patterns
- Follow **database conventions** defined in `docs/ai-guidelines/DATABASE_GUIDELINES.md`
- Maintain **proper separation of concerns** per architecture guidelines

### Testing Standards
- **Achieve test coverage goals** defined in `docs/ai-guidelines/QUALITY_GUIDELINES.md` (typically >80%)
- **Test both happy path and error scenarios** for all new code
- **Use appropriate mocking strategies** following project testing patterns
- **Write clear, descriptive test names** that explain what is being tested
- **Follow test organization** patterns from the project guidelines

## Ask for User Input

During task implementation, ask for user input when:

1. **Non-trivial UI updates or design decisions**:
   - **CRITICAL**: For any UI changes that affect layout, styling, or user experience, always ask for user input first
   - **Show examples when possible**: Use terminal commands to display current UI elements, show mockups, or describe visual changes
   - Example: "This task requires updating the navigation menu. Here are the current options: [show current menu]. Should I: (1) add a new menu item at the end, (2) reorganize existing items, or (3) create a dropdown submenu?"
   - Example: "The form layout needs updating. Current layout: [describe/show current]. Proposed options: (1) single column with larger fields, (2) two-column layout, or (3) tabbed sections. Which would you prefer?"

2. **Ambiguity in implementation details**:
   - Example: "The task specifies 'user notifications' but doesn't specify the delivery method. Should this be: (1) in-app notifications only, (2) email notifications, or (3) both?"

3. **Multiple valid approaches exist**:
   - Example: "This feature could be implemented with: (1) client-side filtering (faster but limited scalability) or (2) server-side filtering (better for large datasets). Which approach would you prefer?"

4. **Critical architectural decisions not specified in task**:
   - Example: "The task requires real-time updates but doesn't specify the approach. Should we use: (1) WebSocket connections, (2) Server-Sent Events, or (3) polling?"

5. **Security or privacy implications discovered**:
   - Example: "This feature will expose user email addresses. Should we: (1) hash/obfuscate emails in the UI, (2) require additional permissions, or (3) proceed as specified?"

6. **Performance concerns identified**:
   - Example: "Loading all records at once could impact performance with large datasets. Should I implement pagination or lazy loading even though it's not in the task spec?"

7. **Missing dependencies or prerequisites**:
   - Example: "This task requires authentication middleware that doesn't exist yet. Should I: (1) create basic auth middleware, (2) use a third-party library like Passport.js, or (3) wait for a separate auth task?"

8. **Breaking changes discovered**:
   - Example: "Implementing this feature requires changing the existing API response format, which could break existing clients. Should I: (1) version the API, (2) add the new fields alongside existing ones, or (3) coordinate a breaking change?"

9. **Test failures unrelated to new code**:
   - Example: "Existing tests are failing before my changes. Should I: (1) fix the existing tests, (2) skip them temporarily, or (3) investigate the root cause first?"

10. **Build or linting errors in existing code**:
    - Example: "The build is failing due to existing code issues unrelated to this task. Should I fix those issues as part of this task or address them separately?"

11. **Unclear acceptance criteria**:
    - Example: "Acceptance criteria says 'fast response time' but doesn't specify a target. What's the acceptable response time for this feature?"

**How to ask for input**:
- Present 2-3 specific options with clear trade-offs
- Explain why the decision matters for this task
- Provide a recommended approach based on project patterns
- Make it easy for user to choose (numbered options)
- **For UI changes**: Show current state and proposed options visually when possible
- **Use terminal commands** to display current UI elements, show mockups, or describe visual changes
- Don't proceed with implementation until user responds

**Examples of showing UI changes in terminal**:
```bash
# Show current component structure
find src/components -name "*.tsx" | head -10

# Display current navigation structure
grep -r "Navigation" src/components --include="*.tsx" -A 5

# Show current styling patterns
grep -r "sx=" src/components --include="*.tsx" | head -5

# Display current form layouts
grep -r "TextField\|Input" src/components --include="*.tsx" | head -5
```
