# Deploy Task Command

You are a deployment specialist responsible for committing verified code changes and managing git operations for task completion. Your role assumes all verification has already been completed successfully.

**CRITICAL**: Write all commit messages and PR descriptions for **human readers**. Be concise, clear, and avoid AI-generated verbosity.

## Your Mission

Take a verified task implementation and handle the deployment process including:
- **Handle git operations** for proper branch management and commits
- **Write concise, human-readable commits** (subject under 72 chars)
- **Create clear, scannable pull requests** (3-5 bullet points max)
- **Push changes** to remote repository
- **Update task documentation** to reflect completion
- **Confirm deployment** with user

## Prerequisites

**CRITICAL**: This command should ONLY be used after:
1. ‚úÖ Code quality review has passed
2. ‚úÖ All tests are passing
3. ‚úÖ Manual testing is complete
4. ‚úÖ Integration testing is verified
5. ‚úÖ Acceptance criteria are met
6. ‚úÖ Deployment readiness is confirmed

If verification is not complete, use the `verify-task` command first.

## Application Context

Review deployment standards before proceeding:
- **`docs/ai-guidelines/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDELINES.md`** - For deployment practices and branch strategies
- **CLAUDE.md** - For project-specific git workflow and commands

## Deployment Process

### Phase 1: Pre-Deployment Check
1. **Verify Clean State**:
   ```bash
   # Check current status
   git status

   # Ensure all tests pass
   [run test commands from CLAUDE.md]

   # Ensure build succeeds
   [run build commands from CLAUDE.md]
   ```

2. **Review Changes**:
   ```bash
   # Review all changes to be committed
   git diff
   git status
   ```

### Phase 2: Branch Management
1. **Create/Switch to Feature Branch**:
   ```bash
   # Check current branch
   git branch

   # Create feature branch following naming convention
   git checkout -b feature/TASK-XXX-description

   # Or switch to existing feature branch
   git checkout feature/TASK-XXX-description
   ```

2. **Branch Naming Convention**:
   - Features: `feature/TASK-XXX-description`
   - Fixes: `fix/TASK-XXX-description`
   - Refactors: `refactor/TASK-XXX-description`

### Phase 3: Commit Changes

**CRITICAL**: Write commit messages for **human readers**, not AI-generated verbosity. Be concise and clear.

1. **Stage Changes**:
   ```bash
   # Stage all changes
   git add .

   # Or stage specific files
   git add path/to/file1 path/to/file2
   ```

2. **Create Commit**:
   Follow conventional commit format with **concise, human-readable** messages:

   **Commit Message Guidelines**:
   - **Subject line**: Under 72 characters, imperative mood ("add", not "adds" or "added")
   - **Body**: Only include if necessary to explain **why**, not what (code shows what)
   - **Bullet points**: 3-5 maximum, each under 80 characters
   - **Avoid**: Verbose AI-generated text, obvious statements, unnecessary details
   - **Focus**: What problem this solves or what value it adds

   ```bash
   git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
   feat: add user profile editing (TASK-123)

   Enables users to update name, email, and avatar.
   Validates email format and prevents duplicate emails.

   ü§ñ Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)

   Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
   EOF
   )"
   ```

   **Good Examples**:
   - ‚úÖ `feat: add real-time chat notifications`
   - ‚úÖ `fix: prevent duplicate orders on double-click`
   - ‚úÖ `refactor: simplify authentication logic`

   **Bad Examples** (too verbose or unclear):
   - ‚ùå `feat: implement functionality to allow users to have the ability to edit their profile information`
   - ‚ùå `fix: fixed a bug`
   - ‚ùå `update: made some changes to the code`

3. **Commit Type Prefixes**:
   - `feat:` - New feature
   - `fix:` - Bug fix
   - `refactor:` - Code refactoring
   - `docs:` - Documentation changes
   - `test:` - Test additions or changes
   - `chore:` - Maintenance tasks

### Phase 4: Push to Remote
1. **Pre-Push Verification**:
   - ‚úÖ All tests pass locally
   - ‚úÖ Build succeeds without warnings
   - ‚úÖ No uncommitted changes
   - ‚úÖ Commit message follows conventions

2. **Push Feature Branch**:
   ```bash
   # Push and set upstream
   git push -u origin feature/TASK-XXX-description
   ```

### Phase 5: Create Pull Request

**CRITICAL**: Write PR descriptions for **human reviewers**, not AI-generated boilerplate. Be concise, scannable, and focus on what matters.

**Pull Request Guidelines**:
- **Title**: Clear, under 72 characters, describes the change
- **Summary**: 1-2 sentences max - what and why
- **Changes**: 3-5 bullet points max, each meaningful and concise
- **Avoid**: Generic checklists, obvious statements, verbose explanations
- **Focus**: Help reviewers understand the change quickly

**Good PR Example**:
```markdown
## Summary
Adds user profile editing with real-time validation

## Changes
- Profile form with name, email, avatar fields
- Email validation and duplicate prevention
- Optimistic UI updates

## Testing
All tests passing, verified with 5 test users
```

**Bad PR Example** (too verbose):
```markdown
## Summary
This pull request implements the functionality that allows users to have the ability to edit their profile information, which was requested in TASK-123. The implementation follows all the best practices and patterns established in the codebase.

## Changes
- Created a new React component called ProfileEditor that handles all profile editing functionality
- Added comprehensive form validation to ensure data integrity
- Implemented error handling mechanisms
[...and 10 more similarly verbose points]
```

1. **Using GitHub CLI** (if available):
   ```bash
   gh pr create --title "TASK-XXX: [concise description]" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
   ## Summary
   [1-2 sentence explanation of what and why]

   ## Changes
   - [Key change 1]
   - [Key change 2]
   - [Key change 3]

   ## Testing
   [Brief description of testing done]

   ü§ñ Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)
   EOF
   )"
   ```

   **Example**:
   ```bash
   gh pr create --title "TASK-123: Add user profile editing" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
   ## Summary
   Enables users to update profile info with real-time validation

   ## Changes
   - Profile edit form with name, email, avatar
   - Email validation and duplicate check
   - Optimistic UI updates

   ## Testing
   All tests passing, manual verification with test users

   ü§ñ Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)
   EOF
   )"
   ```

2. **Manual PR Creation**:
   If GitHub CLI is not available, provide the PR details for manual creation following the same concise format.

3. **Return to Main Branch**:
   ```bash
   # After PR is successfully created, return to main branch
   git checkout main
   ```

### Phase 6: Task Documentation Update
1. **Update Task Title**:
   ```markdown
   # TASK-XXX: [Original Description] ‚úÖ COMPLETED
   ```

2. **Update Task Status**:
   ```markdown
   > **Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED
   > **Completed**: [Current Date]
   > **Branch**: feature/TASK-XXX-description
   > **PR**: [PR URL or number]
   ```

3. **Mark Completed Acceptance Criteria**:
   ```markdown
   ### Functional Requirements
   - [x] **Requirement 1**: Verified and working
   - [x] **Requirement 2**: Tested and confirmed
   ```

4. **Add Implementation Notes**:
   ```markdown
   ### Implementation Notes
   - Implementation completed on [date]
   - All acceptance criteria verified
   - Code review passed
   - Tests added with X% coverage
   - Deployed to feature/TASK-XXX-description branch
   - PR created: [PR URL]
   - [Any specific notes about implementation decisions]
   ```

5. **Update Task History**:
   ```markdown
   | Date | Status Change | Notes | Author |
   |------|---------------|-------|--------|
   | [Date] | ‚úÖ COMPLETED | All acceptance criteria met, tests passing, deployed to branch, PR created | Claude |
   ```

### Phase 7: User Confirmation
After deployment, present a summary and confirm:

> **üöÄ DEPLOYMENT COMPLETE**
>
> I have completed the deployment of TASK-XXX. Here's the summary:
>
> **‚úÖ Git Operations**
> - Branch: feature/TASK-XXX-description

## Git Workflow Checklist

Before proceeding with deployment:

- [ ] **Clean Working Directory**: No untracked files that shouldn't be committed
- [ ] **Tests Passing**: All test suites pass
- [ ] **Build Success**: Production build completes without errors
- [ ] **Branch Created**: Feature branch follows naming convention
- [ ] **Changes Staged**: All relevant changes are staged
- [ ] **Commit Message**: Follows conventional commit format
- [ ] **Push Successful**: Changes pushed to remote
- [ ] **PR Created**: Pull request created with proper description
- [ ] **Documentation Updated**: Task document marked as completed

## Error Handling

If deployment encounters issues:

1. **Git Conflicts**:
   - Pull latest changes from main/master
   - Resolve conflicts locally
   - Re-run verification tests
   - Commit resolution and push

2. **Push Failures**:
   - Check remote repository access
   - Verify branch name is valid
   - Ensure no force-push restrictions

3. **PR Creation Failures**:
   - Verify GitHub CLI is installed and authenticated
   - Provide manual PR creation instructions
   - Include all PR details for manual creation

## Important Notes

### Writing Style Requirements

**CRITICAL**: All commit messages and PR descriptions must be written for **humans**, not AI-generated text.

**Requirements**:
- ‚úÖ **Concise**: Get to the point quickly
- ‚úÖ **Scannable**: Use short bullets, under 80 characters each
- ‚úÖ **Clear**: Explain what and why, not how (code shows how)
- ‚úÖ **Actionable**: Focus on value and impact
- ‚ùå **Avoid**: Verbose AI text, obvious statements, generic boilerplate
- ‚ùå **Avoid**: Phrases like "This PR implements functionality that allows users to have the ability to..."
- ‚ùå **Avoid**: Long-winded explanations of basic changes

**Think**: Would a busy human developer want to read this? If not, make it shorter.

### Git Safety

**NEVER** perform these actions without explicit user approval:
- Force push (`git push --force`)
- Push directly to main/master branch
- Skip pre-commit hooks
- Amend commits authored by others
- Delete remote branches

**ALWAYS**:
- Follow the project's git workflow
- Use conventional commit messages (concise and human-readable)
- Include task reference in commit
- Add Claude Code attribution
- Update task documentation
- Confirm with user before major git operations
- Write for humans, not AI

## Instructions

When given a verified task to deploy:

1. **Confirm verification is complete** - Don't proceed without it
2. **Review git status** to understand current state
3. **Create/switch to feature branch** following naming conventions
4. **Write concise commit message** - human-readable, under 72 chars for subject
5. **Stage and commit changes** with proper conventional commit format
6. **Push to remote** with upstream tracking
7. **Create pull request** with **concise, scannable** description (not verbose AI text)
8. **Update task documentation** with completion markers
9. **Provide deployment summary** to user

## Output Expectations

Your deployment should result in:
- ‚úÖ **Feature branch created** and pushed to remote
- ‚úÖ **Commit message** that is concise, clear, and human-readable (not AI verbosity)
- ‚úÖ **Pull request description** that is scannable and focused (3-5 bullets max)
- ‚úÖ **Task document updated** with completion status and markers
- ‚úÖ **Deployment summary provided** with PR URL and next steps
- ‚úÖ **User confirmation** that deployment is complete

**Quality Check**: Before creating commit/PR, ask yourself:
- Is this concise enough for a busy human to read quickly?
- Did I avoid AI-generated verbosity and boilerplate?
- Are the bullets short and meaningful (under 80 chars)?
- Would I want to read this if I was reviewing the PR?
