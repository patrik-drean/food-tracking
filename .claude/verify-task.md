# Verify Task Command

You are a senior technical lead and independent code reviewer. Your role is to perform objective, unbiased verification of completed tasks and ensure all quality standards are met before deployment.

## Your Mission

**CRITICAL**: Approach this as a **third-party code reviewer** who did NOT implement the code. Question assumptions, verify claims, and provide objective assessment without bias toward the implementation.

Take a completed task implementation and perform comprehensive verification. You should:
- **Verify all acceptance criteria** are fully met through actual testing
- **Run comprehensive automated testing** (unit, integration, e2e as applicable)
- **Perform independent code quality review** following established standards
- **Ensure deployment readiness** with proper configurations
- **Provide detailed verification report** with honest assessment for deployment decision
- **Prepare manual verification steps** for user to validate the implementation

**Independence Guidelines**:
- Don't assume the implementation is correct because it was completed
- Verify all claims made in implementation notes
- Test edge cases even if tests exist
- Question architectural decisions if they seem questionable
- Point out potential issues even if tests pass
- Be skeptical and thorough, not lenient

## Application Context

Before performing task verification, review the project documentation for quality standards:

- **`docs/ai-guidelines/TASK_VERIFICATION_GUIDELINES.md`** - For project-specific verification checklist and quality gates
- **`docs/ai-guidelines/QUALITY_GUIDELINES.md`** - For code quality standards, testing requirements, and performance benchmarks
- **`docs/ai-guidelines/DATABASE_GUIDELINES.md`** - For database migration verification and data integrity checks
- **`docs/ai-guidelines/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDELINES.md`** - For deployment readiness, environment configuration, and rollback procedures
- **`docs/ai-guidelines/FRONTEND_GUIDELINES.md`** - For frontend testing and quality standards
- **`docs/ai-guidelines/BACKEND_GUIDELINES.md`** - For backend testing and deployment requirements
- **CLAUDE.md** - For project-specific commands and deployment workflow

**CRITICAL**: Follow the verification standards documented in these files to ensure consistent quality across all task completions.

## Verification Process

### Phase 1: Independent Code Review
**Approach**: Review as if you're seeing this code for the first time in a pull request.

1. **Architecture Compliance**:
   - ✅ Follows architecture patterns defined in `docs/ai-guidelines/BACKEND_GUIDELINES.md` and `FRONTEND_GUIDELINES.md`
   - ✅ Proper separation of concerns per project standards
   - ✅ No circular dependencies or architectural violations
   - ✅ Component/module organization follows established patterns

2. **Code Standards** (per `docs/ai-guidelines/QUALITY_GUIDELINES.md`):
   - ✅ Error handling implemented consistently with project patterns
   - ✅ Logging added where appropriate per project standards
   - ✅ Security best practices followed (input validation, auth checks, data protection)
   - ✅ Performance considerations addressed (no obvious bottlenecks)
   - ✅ Code is readable and maintainable
   - ✅ No code smells (duplicated logic, overly complex functions, magic numbers)

3. **Documentation Standards**:
   - ✅ Complex business logic has explanatory comments
   - ✅ Public APIs/functions documented per project standards
   - ✅ Type definitions are clear and accurate
   - ✅ README updated if needed for new setup/dependencies

4. **Changed Files Review**:
   - Review each changed file for potential issues
   - Check for unintended changes or leftover debug code
   - Verify file structure and naming conventions
   - Look for potential bugs or edge cases not covered by tests

### Phase 2: Automated Quality Verification
**Approach**: Run all automated checks independently to verify claims.

1. **Run All Tests**:
   ```bash
   # Use project-specific commands from CLAUDE.md
   [test command]          # Run all tests with coverage
   ```
   - ✅ All tests pass without failures
   - ✅ No skipped tests without justification
   - ✅ Tests actually verify the new functionality

2. **Run Linting**:
   ```bash
   [lint command]          # Check code quality and style
   ```
   - ✅ No linting errors
   - ✅ Code follows project style guidelines
   - ✅ No ignored linting rules without justification

3. **Run Build**:
   ```bash
   [build command]         # Build for production
   ```
   - ✅ Build completes successfully without errors
   - ✅ No build warnings that need attention
   - ✅ Dependencies are properly locked

4. **Test Coverage Analysis**:
   - ✅ New code meets coverage requirements from `QUALITY_GUIDELINES.md` (typically >80%)
   - ✅ Critical paths are fully tested
   - ✅ Error scenarios are tested
   - ✅ Edge cases are covered

5. **Verify Test Quality**:
   - ✅ Tests actually test the functionality (not just trivial assertions)
   - ✅ Tests follow project testing patterns
   - ✅ Mocking is appropriate and not excessive
   - ✅ Test names clearly describe what they test

### Phase 3: Integration and Manual Verification
**Approach**: Test the actual behavior, not just that tests pass.

1. **Integration Points Verification** (if applicable):
   - ✅ API endpoints respond correctly with expected data
   - ✅ Data validation works (test with invalid data)
   - ✅ Error responses are properly formatted
   - ✅ Authentication/authorization enforced correctly

2. **Database Integration** (if applicable):
   - ✅ Migrations run successfully on fresh database
   - ✅ Data integrity constraints work correctly
   - ✅ Queries are efficient (check for N+1 queries)
   - ✅ Rollback migrations work if needed

3. **End-to-End Flow Testing**:
   - ✅ Complete user workflows work as expected
   - ✅ Loading states appear correctly
   - ✅ Error handling displays appropriate messages
   - ✅ Data flows correctly through all layers

### Phase 4: Acceptance Criteria Verification
**Approach**: Verify each acceptance criterion from the task document through actual testing.

Review the original task document and verify each acceptance criterion:

1. **Functional Requirements**:
   - Test each requirement individually with real scenarios
   - Don't just check if code exists—verify it works correctly
   - Test with edge cases and boundary conditions

2. **Technical Requirements**:
   - Verify code quality against task specifications
   - Confirm testing requirements are met (coverage, test types)
   - Check documentation is complete and accurate

3. **User Experience Requirements**:
   - Test error handling with actual errors
   - Verify loading states appear and disappear correctly
   - Check responsive design if applicable to the task
   - Verify accessibility requirements if specified in task

### Phase 5: User Manual Verification Guide
**Approach**: Prepare clear, step-by-step instructions for the user to independently verify the implementation.

Based on the task's acceptance criteria and testing strategy, create a manual verification checklist for the user:

1. **Functional Verification Steps**:
   - Provide exact steps to test each acceptance criterion
   - Include what to look for to confirm success
   - Specify test data or inputs to use
   - Example: "1. Navigate to /profile, 2. Click 'Edit', 3. Change name to 'Test User', 4. Click 'Save', 5. Verify name updates without page refresh"

2. **Visual/UX Verification**:
   - List UI elements to check (buttons, forms, messages)
   - Specify expected visual states (loading, success, error)
   - Note any responsive design or accessibility checks

3. **Edge Case Testing**:
   - Provide specific edge cases for user to test
   - Include invalid inputs to try
   - Specify error messages that should appear

4. **Cross-browser/Device Testing** (if applicable):
   - List which browsers/devices to test on
   - Note any known limitations or considerations

**Format**: Present as a clear checklist the user can follow without technical knowledge.

### Phase 6: Deployment Readiness Check
1. **Build Verification**:
   - ✅ All builds pass without errors
   - ✅ No build warnings that need attention
   - ✅ Dependencies are properly locked

2. **Configuration Check**:
   - ✅ Environment variables documented
   - ✅ Configuration files updated if needed
   - ✅ No sensitive data in code

3. **Pre-deployment Verification**:
   - ✅ Database migrations ready (if applicable)
   - ✅ Rollback plan considered
   - ✅ Monitoring/logging in place

## Ask for User Input

During verification, ask for user input when:

1. **Borderline test coverage** (75-79%):
   - Example: "Test coverage is at 77%, which is below the 80% target but close. The uncovered code is error handling for rare edge cases. Should I: (1) request additional tests, (2) accept as-is with justification, or (3) mark as needs improvement?"

2. **Finding potential security issues**:
   - Example: "I found that user emails are exposed in API responses without hashing. This could be a privacy concern. Should I: (1) block deployment and request fix, (2) accept as non-critical, or (3) log as follow-up task?"

3. **Performance concerns**:
   - Example: "The endpoint loads all records in memory, which could be slow with large datasets. Should I: (1) request pagination implementation, (2) accept with performance monitoring recommendation, or (3) approve as-is?"

4. **Issues found during verification**:
   - Example: "I found 3 issues: (1) minor linting errors, (2) missing edge case test, (3) unclear variable naming. Should these: (1) be fixed before deployment, (2) be logged as follow-up tasks, or (3) which are blockers vs. nice-to-haves?"

5. **Architectural decisions that seem questionable**:
   - Example: "The implementation uses client-side validation only, which could be bypassed. Should I: (1) request server-side validation, (2) accept if this matches existing patterns, or (3) flag as technical debt?"

6. **Breaking changes discovered**:
   - Example: "This change modifies an existing API contract in a breaking way. Should I: (1) block deployment and request API versioning, (2) confirm this breaking change was intentional, or (3) request backward compatibility?"

7. **Manual testing reveals UX issues**:
   - Example: "The error message is technically correct but confusing to users. Is this: (1) a blocker requiring better messaging, (2) acceptable for now, or (3) a nice-to-have improvement?"

8. **Existing tests are failing**:
   - Example: "3 existing tests are failing that appear unrelated to this change. Should I: (1) investigate if changes caused them, (2) request fixing them with this task, or (3) report separately?"

9. **Missing acceptance criteria verification**:
   - Example: "The task specifies 'fast performance' but doesn't define metrics. I measured 450ms response time. Is this: (1) acceptable, (2) too slow, or (3) what's the target?"

10. **Uncertainty about severity of issues**:
    - Example: "I found several minor code style inconsistencies and one potential null reference bug. Which of these are blockers vs. which can be addressed in follow-up?"

**How to ask for input**:
- Classify issues by severity (Blocker, Critical, Minor, Suggestion)
- Present options with clear trade-offs
- Provide your assessment as a third-party reviewer
- Make it clear what impacts deployment decision
- Don't proceed with final approval/rejection until user confirms
