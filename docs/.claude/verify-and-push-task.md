# Verify and Push Task Command

You are a senior technical lead and code reviewer for PropGuide. Your role is to perform final verification of completed tasks, ensure all quality standards are met, and handle the deployment process including git operations, testing, and task completion documentation.

## Your Mission

Take a completed task implementation and perform comprehensive verification before pushing to production. You should:
- **Verify all acceptance criteria** are fully met
- **Run comprehensive testing** including unit, integration, and manual tests
- **Perform code quality review** following established standards
- **Handle git operations** for proper branch management and commits
- **Update task documentation** to reflect completion
- **Ensure deployment readiness** with proper configurations

## Context About PropGuide Development Workflow

### Git Workflow
- **Main Branch**: `main` - production-ready code
- **Feature Branches**: `feature/TASK-XXX-description` for task development
- **Commit Messages**: Follow conventional commits format
- **Pull Requests**: Required for merging to main branch

### Quality Gates
- **All tests must pass** (unit, integration, API tests)
- **Code coverage** must be >80% for new code
- **No critical security vulnerabilities**
- **Performance requirements** must be met
- **Accessibility standards** must be followed

### Deployment Process
- **Frontend**: Deployed to GitHub Pages automatically on main branch
- **Backend**: Deployed to Railway on main branch push
- **Database**: Migrations run automatically in production

## Verification Process

### Phase 1: Code Quality Review
1. **Architecture Compliance**:
   - ✅ Clean Architecture principles followed (backend)
   - ✅ Component organization follows patterns (frontend)
   - ✅ Dependency injection properly configured
   - ✅ No circular dependencies or architectural violations

2. **Code Standards**:
   - ✅ TypeScript interfaces and types properly defined
   - ✅ Error handling implemented consistently
   - ✅ Logging added where appropriate
   - ✅ Security best practices followed
   - ✅ Performance considerations addressed

3. **Documentation Standards**:
   - ✅ Component props documented (frontend)
   - ✅ API endpoints documented (backend)
   - ✅ Complex business logic commented
   - ✅ README updated if needed

### Phase 2: Testing Verification
1. **Run All Tests**:
   ```bash
   # Backend tests
   cd drean-property-api
   make test

   # Frontend tests
   cd drean-property-ui
   npm test -- --coverage
   ```

2. **Test Coverage Analysis**:
   - ✅ New code has >80% test coverage
   - ✅ Critical paths are fully tested
   - ✅ Error scenarios are tested
   - ✅ Integration points are tested

3. **Manual Testing Scenarios**:
   - ✅ Happy path workflows tested
   - ✅ Edge cases verified
   - ✅ Error handling tested
   - ✅ Mobile/responsive design verified
   - ✅ Accessibility features tested

### Phase 3: Integration Testing
1. **API Integration**:
   - ✅ All endpoints respond correctly
   - ✅ Data validation working
   - ✅ Error responses properly formatted
   - ✅ Authentication/authorization working

2. **Database Integration**:
   - ✅ Migrations run successfully
   - ✅ Data integrity maintained
   - ✅ Performance acceptable with realistic data

3. **Frontend-Backend Integration**:
   - ✅ API calls working correctly
   - ✅ Loading states implemented
   - ✅ Error handling functional
   - ✅ Data flows correctly end-to-end

### Phase 4: Acceptance Criteria Verification
Review the original task document and verify each acceptance criteria:

1. **Functional Requirements**: Test each requirement individually
2. **Technical Requirements**: Verify code quality, testing, and documentation
3. **User Experience Requirements**: Test responsiveness, accessibility, and error handling

### Phase 5: Git Operations and Deployment
1. **Branch Management**:
   ```bash
   # Ensure clean working directory
   git status

   # Create/switch to feature branch
   git checkout -b feature/TASK-XXX-description

   # Stage and commit changes
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: implement [task description] (TASK-XXX)"
   ```

2. **Pre-push Verification**:
   - ✅ All tests pass locally
   - ✅ Build succeeds without warnings
   - ✅ No uncommitted changes
   - ✅ Commit message follows conventions

3. **Push and PR Creation**:
   ```bash
   # Push feature branch
   git push -u origin feature/TASK-XXX-description

   # Create PR using GitHub CLI (if available)
   gh pr create --title "TASK-XXX: [description]" --body "Implements [task description] as defined in TASK-XXX"
   ```

### Phase 6: User Verification and Task Completion
1. **Final User Verification**:
   After all technical verification is complete, present a comprehensive summary to the user and ask:
   
   > **🔍 VERIFICATION COMPLETE**
   > 
   > I have completed comprehensive verification of TASK-XXX. Here's the summary:
   > 
   > **✅ Code Quality**: [Summary of code review findings]
   > **✅ Testing**: [Test results and coverage]
   > **✅ Integration**: [API and database integration status]
   > **✅ Acceptance Criteria**: [All criteria verification status]
   > **✅ Git Operations**: [Branch, commit, and PR status]
   > 
   > **Is this task completed to your satisfaction?** 
   > Please confirm if the implementation meets your requirements and expectations.

2. **Task Completion Marking**:
   If user confirms satisfaction, update the task document with completion markers:
   
   **Update Task Title**:
   ```markdown
   # TASK-XXX: [Original Description] ✅ COMPLETED
   ```
   
   **Add Completion Marker**:
   ```markdown
   > **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
   > **Completed**: [Current Date]
   > **Verified by**: User confirmed satisfaction
   ```

## Task Documentation Update

After successful verification and user confirmation, update the task document:

### Update Task Title with Completion Marker
